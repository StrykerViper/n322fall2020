When starting the app you will be brought to the login page once logged in or signed up you will go to the home page here you can logout and view veach of the budget pages. Each page will let you enter in a budget for that area of finance it will upload that to fire base under different documents. Once you enter a budget for each section you can then enter a monthly exspence and hit the get total button. It will then take all of your budgets you have entered and subtract them from your monthly income. My next step is to take those left over savings and figure out how much you will up in 40 years at that rate and a 7% annual return. This way you can see how much you can have using compound interest.(Still working on that side of the app).
